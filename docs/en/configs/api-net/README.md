## Introduction

In order to effectively identify contrastive clues among highly-confused categories, the writers propose a simple but effective Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), which can progressively recognize a pair of fine-grained images by interaction. They aim at learning a mutual vector first to capture semantic differences in the input pair, and then comparing this mutual vector with individual vectors to highlight their semantic differences respectively. Besides, they also introduce a score-ranking regularization to promote the priorities of these features. For more details, please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10191).
