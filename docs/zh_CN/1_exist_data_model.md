## 1: Train with the existing models and satndard datastes

To evaluate a modelâ€™s accuracy, one usually tests the model on some standard datasets. FGVCLib supports the public datasets including CUB_200_2011. This section will show how to test existing models on supported datasets.

## Prepare datasets

The public datasets CUB_200_2011 is available from offical websites or mirrors. It is recommended to download and extract the dataset somewhere outside the project directory and symlink the dataset root to `/data/dataset` as below. 

If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files `./configs`.
